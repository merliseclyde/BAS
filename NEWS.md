# BAS 1.6.5

## Changes

* Added support for `Gamma` regression for `bas.glm`, with unit tests and 
  example  (Code contributed by @betsyberrson)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed error in `coef` for `bas.glm` objects when using a `betaprior` of class
  IC, including AIC and BIC Github issue #65

* Fixed error  when using `Jeffreys` prior in `bas.glm` with the 
`include.always` option and added unit test in `test-bas-glm.R`.  
 Github issue #61

* Fixed error for extracting coefficients from the median probability model
  when a formula is passed as an object rather than a literal, and added
  a unit test to `test-coefficients.R`  Github issues #39 and #56
  

# BAS 1.6.4

## Changes

* skipped test on CRAN that fails to show a warning in the non full rank case 
when `pivot=FALSE` for `bas.lm` as default uses pivoting and documentation 
indicates that `pivot=FALSE` should only be used in the full rank case so that
users should not encounter this issue in practice.  Users will continue to see 
a warning of NA's are returned, but should be aware that not all platforms may
produce a warning (such as M1mac).  Github issue #62

# BAS 1.6.3

## Changes

* Added checks and unit-tests to see if modelprior is of class 'prior' resolving Github Issue #57

* Removed `polevl.c`, `psi.c`  and `gamma.c` from Cephes as no longer used after switching to `R`'s internal functions


# BAS 1.6.2

* replaced deprecated `DOUBLE_EPS` with `DBL_EPSILON` for R 4.2.0 release (in two places) so restore on CRAN

# BAS 1.6.1

## Changes

* replaced deprecated `DOUBLE_EPS` with `DBL_EPSILON` for R 4.2.0 release

* fixed warnings from CRAN checkcs for under R devel  (use of | and  `if` with `class`)


* added a function `trCCH` that uses integration to compute the normalizing constant in the 
  Truncated Compund Confluent Hypergeometric distribution that provides the
  correct normalizing constant for Gordy (1998) and is more stable for large values 
  compared to the current `phi1` function.  This is now used in the `TCCH` prior for `bas.glm`.


* Rewrote `phi1` function to use direct numerical integration (`phi1_int`) when Wald statistic is large so that marginal likelihoods are not NA as suggested by Daniel Heeman and Alexander Ly (see below).  This should improve stability of estimates of Bayes Factors and model probabilities from `bas.glm` that used the `HyperTwo` function, including coefficient priors for `hyper.g.n()`, `robust()`, and `intrinsic()`.  Added additional unit tests.

* Added `thin` as an option for `bas.glm`

* added unit tests and examples to show the connections between the special 
 functions `trCCH`, `phi1`, `1F1` and `2F1`

## Bug Fixes

* added internal function for `phi1_int` when the original `HyperTwo` function returns NA [Issue #55](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/55)  See more details above.

* corrected the shrinkage estimate under the `CCH` prior that did not include
  terms involving the `beta` function.



# BAS 1.6.0

## Changes

* update Fortran code to be compliant with `USE_FC_LEN_T`  for character strings

## Bug Fixes 

* fixed warning in src code for `log_laplace_F21` which had an uninitialized variable 
leading to NaN being returned from `R` function `hypergeometric2F1`

# BAS 1.5.5

##  Changes

* Fixed WARNING under fedora-clang-devel. Added climate.dat file to package for
building vignette so that package does not violate CRAN's policy 
for accessing internet resources and is more permament if file location/url 
changes locally.

* Fixed testthat errors under Solaris.  Default settings for `force.heredity` is
set back to FALSE in `bas.lm` and `bas.glm` so that methods work on all 
platforms.  For Solaris, users who wish to impose the `force.heredity` 
constraint may use the post-processing function.


# BAS 1.5.4

## Features

* Modified prior probabilities to adjust for the number of variables always
included when using include.always.  [Pull request #41](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/pull/41) by Don van de Bergh.  [Issue #40](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/40)

## Bug Fixes 

* Fixed valgrind error in src/ZS_approx_null_np.c for invalid write noted in CRAN checks

* fixed function declaration type-mismatch and argument errors identified by LTO noted in CRAN checks

* Added `contrast=NULL` argument to `bas.lm` and `bas.glm` so that non-NULL contrasts do not
trigger warning in `model.matrix` as of R 3.6.0.  [Bug #44](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/44)

* Added check for sample size equal to zero due to subsetting or missing data
[Bug #37](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/37)

## Other 

* Put ORCID in quotes in author list (per R-dev changes)


#  BAS 1.5.3

## Bug Fixes  

Fixed errors identified on cran checks https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_BAS.html

* initialize R2_m = 0.0 in lm_mcmcbas.c  (lead to NA's with clang on debian and fedora )

* switch to default of `pivot = TRUE` in `bas.lm`, adding `tol` as an argument to control tolerance in `cholregpovot` for improved stability across platforms with singular or nearly singular designs.

* valgrind messages: Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s). Initialize vectors allocated via R_alloc in lm_deterministic.c and glm_deterministic.c.

# BAS 1.5.2  

## Features

* Included an option `pivot=TRUE` in `bas.lm` to fit the models using a pivoted Cholesky decomposition to allow models that are rank-deficient.  [Enhancement #24](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/24) and [Bug #21](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/21).  Currently coefficients that are not-estimable are set to zero so that `predict` and other methods will work as before.  The vector `rank` is added to the output (see documentation for `bas.lm`) and the degrees of freedom methods that assume a uniform prior for obtaining estimates (AIC and BIC) are adjusted to use `rank` rather than `size`.  

* Added option `force.heredity=TRUE`to force lower order terms to be included if higher order terms are present (hierarchical constraint) for `method='MCMC'` and `method='BAS'` with `bas.lm` and `bas.glm`.  Updated Vignette to illustrate. [enhancement #19](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/19).  Checks to see if  _parents_ are included using `include.always` pass  [issue #26](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/26).

* Added option `drop.always.included` to `image.bas` so that variables that are always included may be excluded from the image. By default all are shown [enhancement #23](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/23)

* Added option `drop.always.included` and `subset` to `plot.bas` so that variables that are always included may be excluded from the plot showing the marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (`which=4`). By default all are shown [enhancement #23](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/23)

* update `fitted.bas` to use predict so that code covers both GLM and LM cases with `type='link'` or `type='response'`

* Updates to package for [CII Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2055)  certification

* Added [Code Coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/merliseclyde/BAS) support and more extensive tests using `test_that`.

## Bugs

* fixed [issue #36](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/36) Errors in prior = "ZS-null" when R2 is not finite or out of range due to model being not full rank. Change  in `gexpectations` function in file `bayesreg.c`

* fixed  [issue #35](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/35) for `method="MCMC+BAS"` in `bas.glm`  in `glm_mcmcbas.c` when no values are provided for `MCMC.iterations` or `n.models` and defaults are used.  Added unit test in `test-bas-glm.R`

* fixed  [issue #34](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/34) for `bas.glm` where variables in `include.always` had marginal inclusion probabilities that were incorrect.  Added unit test in `test-bas-glm.R`

* fixed [issue #33](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/33)  for Jeffreys prior where marginal inclusion probabilities were not renormalized after dropping intercept model 

* fixed [issue #32](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/32) 
to allow vectorization for `phi1` function in R/cch.R
and added unit test to "tests/testthat/test-special-functions.R"

* fixed  [issue #31](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/30) to coerce `g` to be a REAL for `g.prior` prior and `IC.prior` in `bas.glm`; added unit-test "tests/testthat/test-bas-glm.R"

* fixed  [issue #30](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/30) added n as hyperparameter if NULL and coerced to be a REAL for `intrinsic` prior in `bas.glm`; added unit-test

* fixed  [issue #29](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/29) added n as hyperparameter if NULL and coerced to be a REAL for `beta.prime` prior in `bas.glm`; added unit-test

* fixed  [issue #28](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/28)  fixed length of MCMC estimates of marginal inclusion probabilities; added unit-test


* fixed  [issue #27](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/27) where expected shrinkage with the JZS prior was greater than 1.  Added unit test.

* fixed output `include.always` to include the intercept [issue #26](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/26) always so that `drop.always.included = TRUE` drops the intercept and any other variables that are forced in.    `include.always` and `force.heredity=TRUE` can now be used together with `method="BAS"`.

* added warning if marginal likelihoods/posterior probabilities are NA with default model fitting method with suggestion that models be rerun with `pivot = TRUE`.  This uses a modified Cholesky decomposition with pivoting so that if the model is rank deficient or nearly singular the dimensionality is reduced.  [Bug #21](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/21).   

* corrected count for first model with `method='MCMC'` which lead to potential model with 0 probability and errors in `image`.

* coerced predicted values to be a vector under BMA (was a matrix)

* fixed `size` with using `method=deterministic` in `bas.glm` (was not updated) 

* fixed problem in `confint` with `horizontal=TRUE` when intervals are point mass at zero.

## Other

*  suppress `warning` when sampling probabilities are 1 or 0 and the number of models is decremented  
[Issue #25](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/25)

* changed `force.heredity.bas` to  renormalize the prior probabilities  rather than to use a new prior probability based on heredity constraints.  For future,  add new priors for models based on heredity.  See comment on  [issue #26](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/26).

* Changed License to GPL 3.0

# BAS 1.5.1  June 6, 2018

## Features

* added S3 method `variable.names` to extract variable names in the highest probability model, median probability
model, and best probability model for objects created by `predict`.

## Bugs

* Fixed incorrect documentation in `predict.basglm` which had that  `type = "link"` was the default for prediction [issue #18](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/18)

# BAS 1.5.0  May 2, 2018

## Features

* add na.action for handling NA's for predict methods 
[issue #10]( https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/10)

* added `include.always` as new argument to `bas.lm`.  This allows a formula to specify which terms should always be included in all models.  By default the intercept is always included.

* added a section to the vignette to illustrate weighted regression and the 
`force.heredity.bas` function to group levels of a factor so that they enter 
or leave the model together.



## Bugs

* fixed problem if there is only one model for `image` function;  
github [issue #11](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/11)

* fixed error in `bas.lm` with non-equal weights where R2 was incorrect.
 [issue #17](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS/issues/17)
## Deprecated 
 
* deprecate the `predict` argument in `predict.bas`, `predict.basglm` and internal functions as it is not utilized


#  BAS 1.4.9 March 24, 2018

## Bugs

* fixed bug in `confint.coef.bas` when parm is a character string
* added parentheses in betafamily.c line 382 as indicated in CRAN check for R devel
 
## Features

* added option to determine k for `Bayes.outlier` if prior 
probability of no outliers is provided

#  BAS 1.4.8 March 10, 2018

## Bugs 

* fixed issue with scoping in eval of data in `predict.bas` if dataname is defined in local env.

* fixed issue 10 in github (predict for estimator='BPM'
failed  if there were NA's in the X data.  Delete NA's
before finding the closest model.

* fixed bug in 'JZS' prior - merged pull request #12 from vandenman/master

* fixed bug in bas.glm when default betaprior (CCH) is used and inputs were INTEGER instead of REAL

* removed warning with use of 'ZS-null' for backwards compatibility

## Features added

* updated print.bas to reflect changes in print.lm

* Added Bayes.outlier function to calculate posterior probabilities of outliers using the method from 
Chaloner & Brant for linear models.

#  BAS 1.4.7 October 22, 2017

## Updates

* Added new method for `bas.lm` to obtain marginal likelihoods with the Zellner-Siow Priors for "prior= 'JZS' using QUADMATH routines for numerical integration.  The optional hyperparameter alpha may now be used to adjust the scaling of the ZS prior where g ~ G(1/2, alpha*n/2) as in the `BayesFactor` package of Morey, with a default of alpha=1 corresponding to the ZS prior used in Liang et al (2008).  This also uses more stable evaluations of log(1 + x) to prevent underflow/overflow.

* Priors `ZS-full` for bas.lm is planned to be deprecated.  

* replaced math functions to use portable C code from Rmath and consolidated header files

#  BAS 1.4.6 May 24, 2017

## Updates

*  Added force.heredity.interaction function to allow higher order interactions to be included only if their "parents" or lower order interactions or main effects were included.   Currently tested with two way interactions.  This is implemented post-sampling; future  updates will add this at the sampling stage which will reduce memory usage and sampling times by reducing the number of models under consideration.

## Bugs

* Fixed unprotected ANS in C code in glm_sampleworep.c and sampleworep.c after call to PutRNGstate and possible stack imbalance in glm_mcmc.

* Fixed problem with predict for estimator=BPM when newdata was one row 


#  BAS 1.4.5 March 28, 2017

## Bugs

* Fixed non-conformable error with `predict` when new data was from a dataframe with one row.

* Fixed problem with missing weights for prediction using the median probability model with no new data.

#  BAS 1.4.4 March 14, 2017

## Updates 

* Extract coefficient summaries, credible intervals and plots for the `HPM` and ` MPM` in addition to the default `BMA` by adding a new `estimator` argument to the `coef` function. The new `n.models` argument to `coef` provides summaries based on the top `n.models` highest probability models to reduce computation time. 'n.models = 1' is equivalent to the highest probability model.

* use of newdata that is a vector is now deprecated for predict.bas; newdata must be a dataframe or missing, in which case fitted values based on the dataframe used in fitting is used

* factor levels are handled as in `lm` or `glm` for prediction when there may be only level of a factor in the newdata

## Bugs

* fixed issue for prediction when newdata has just one row

* fixed missing id in plot.bas for which=3

#  BAS 1.4.3  February 18, 2017

## Updates

* Register symbols for foreign function calls
* bin2int is now deprecated
* fixed default MCMC.iteration in `bas.lm` to agree with documentation
* updated vignette to include more examples, outlier detection, and finding the best predictive probability model
* set a flag for MCMC sampling `renormalize` that selects whether the Monte Carlo frequencies are used to estimate posterior model and marginal inclusion probabilities (default `renormalize = FALSE`) or that marginal likelihoods time prior probabilities that are renormalized to sum to 1 are used.  (the latter is the only option for the other methods); new slots for probne0.MCMC, probne0.RN, postprobs.RN and postprobs.MCMC.

## Bug fixes

 *  fixed problem with prior.bic, robust, and hyper.g.n where default had missing n that was not set in hyperparameters
 * fixed error in predict and plot for GLMs when family is provided as a function
 

# BAS 1.4.2   October 12, 2016

## Updates

* added df to the object returned by bas.glm to simplify `coefficients` function.

# BAS 1.4.1   September 17, 2016

## Bug Fixes

  errors if the response was transformed as part of the formula; 
  this is fixed 

## Features
* added subset argument to `bas.lm` and `bas.glm`

# BAS 1.4.0   August 25, 2016

## New features

* added `na.action` for `bas.lm` and `bas.glm` to omit missing data.
* new function to plot credible intervals created by `confint.pred.bas` or `confint.coef.bas`.   See the help files for an example or the vignette.
* added `se.fit` option in `predict.basglm`.
* Added `testBF` as a `betaprior` option for `bas.glm` to implement Bayes Factors based on the likelihood ratio statistic's distribution for GLMs.
* DOI for this version is http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60948


# BAS 1.3.0   July 15, 2016

* new function for adding credible intervals for coefficients  `confint.coef.bas()` 
* added posterior standard deviations for fitted values and predicted values in  `predict.bas()`
  


## Deprecation 
* deprecated use of `type` to specify estimator in fitted.bas	and replaced with `estimator` so that `predict()` and `fitted()` are compatible with other S3 methods. 
* updated functions to be of class `bas` to avoid NAMESPACE conflicts with  other libraries
	

# BAS 1.2.2 June 29, 2016

## New Features
* added option to find "Best Predictive Model" or "BPM" for `fitted.bas` or `predict.bas`
* added local Empirical Bayes prior and fixed g-prior for `bas.glm`
* added `diagnostic()` function for checking convergence of `bas` objects created with `method = "MCMC"`"
* added truncated power prior as in Yang, Wainwright & Jordan (2016)

##	Minor Changes

* bug fix in `plot.bas` that appears with Sweave
* bug fix in `coef.bma` when there is just one predictor

	be sampled.
* fixed error in Zellner-Siow prior (ZS-null) when n=p+1 or
	saturated model  where log marginal likelihood should be 0 

# BAS 1.2.0  April 11, 2016
* removed unsafe code where Rbestmarg (input) was being
	overwritten in .Call which would end up in corruption of the
	constant pool of the byte-code  (Thanks to Tomas Kalibera for
	catching this!)
* fixed issue with dimensions for use with Simple Linear Regression

# BAS 1.1.0   March 31, 2016

## New Features

	only with MCMC currently)
* improved code for finding fitted values under the Median 
* deprecated method = "AMCMC" and issue warning message

## Minor Changes
* Changed S3 method for plot and image to use class `bas` rather than
	 `bma` to avoid name conflicts with other packages
