# [BAS: An R package for Bayesian Model Averaging using Adaptive Samping ](https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS)

The main aim of the *BAS* [R](http://r-project.org) package is to
provide an easy to use package and fast package for implementing Bayesian Model
Averaging and Model Selection in R using state of the art prior
distributions for linear and generalized linear models

# Installation

The stable version [![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BAS)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BAS) can be installed easily in the `R` console like any other package:

```r
install.packages('BAS')
```

On the other hand, I welcome everyone to use the most recent version of the package with quick-fixes, new features and probably new bugs. It's currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/merliseclyde/VAS). To get the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/merliseclyde) of the `devtools` package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

```r
devtools::install_github('merliseclyde/BAS')
```
