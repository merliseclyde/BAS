#' Bodyfat Data
#'
#' Lists estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater
#' weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men.  Accurate
#' measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have
#' easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly.
#'
#' A variety of popular health books suggest that the readers assess their
#' health, at least in part, by estimating their percentage of body fat. In
#' Bailey (1994), for instance, the reader can estimate body fat from tables
#' using their age and various skin-fold measurements obtained by using a
#' caliper. Other texts give predictive equations for body fat using body
#' circumference measurements (e.g. abdominal circumference) and/or skin-fold
#' measurements. See, for instance, Behnke and Wilmore (1974), pp. 66-67;
#' Wilmore (1976), p. 247; or Katch and McArdle (1977), pp. 120-132).#
#'
#' Percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated once body density
#' has been determined. Folks (e.g. Siri (1956)) assume that the body consists
#' of two components - lean body tissue and fat tissue. Letting
#'
#' D = Body Density (gm/cm^3) A = proportion of lean body tissue B = proportion
#' of fat tissue (A+B=1) a = density of lean body tissue (gm/cm^3) b = density
#' of fat tissue (gm/cm^3)
#'
#' we have D = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)] and solving for B we find B = (1/D)*[ab/(a-b)]
#' - [b/(a-b)].
#'
#' Using the estimates a=1.10 gm/cm^3 and b=0.90 gm/cm^3 (see Katch and McArdle
#' (1977), p. 111 or Wilmore (1976), p. 123) we come up with "Siri's equation":
#'
#' Percentage of Body Fat (i.e. 100*B) = 495/D - 450.#
#'
#' Volume, and hence body density, can be accurately measured a variety of
#' ways. The technique of underwater weighing "computes body volume as the
#' difference between body weight measured in air and weight measured during
#' water submersion. In other words, body volume is equal to the loss of weight
#' in water with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's
#' density" (Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 113). Using this technique,
#'
#' Body Density = WA/[(WA-WW)/c.f. - LV]
#'
#' where WA = Weight in air (kg) WW = Weight in water (kg) c.f. = Water
#' correction factor (=1 at 39.2 deg F as one-gram of water occupies exactly
#' one cm^3 at this temperature, =.997 at 76-78 deg F) LV = Residual Lung
#' Volume (liters)
#'
#' (Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 115). Other methods of determining body volume
#' are given in Behnke and Wilmore (1974), p. 22 ff.
#'
#' Measurement standards are apparently those listed in Behnke and Wilmore
#' (1974), pp. 45-48 where, for instance, the abdomen circumference is measured
#' "laterally, at the level of the iliac crests, and anteriorly, at the
#' umbilicus".)

#' Climate Data
#' @name climate

#' @format Scientists are interested in the Earth's temperature change since the last
#' glacial maximum, about 20,000 years ago. The first study to estimate the

#'  C, +/- 1.2 degrees C in tropical sea surface temperatures.
#'  The negative value means that the Earth was colder then than now.
#'  Since 1980 there have been many other studies.

#' Hald Data
#'
#' The Hald data have been used in many books and papers to illustrate variable
#' selection. The data relate to an engineering application that was concerned
#' with the effect of the composition of cement on heat evolved during
#' hardening. The response variable \emph{Y} is the \emph{heat evolved} in a
#' cement mix. The four explanatory variables are ingredients of the mix, X1:
#' \emph{tricalcium aluminate}, X2: \emph{tricalcium silicate}, X3:
#' \emph{tetracalcium alumino ferrite}, X4: \emph{dicalcium silicate}. An
#' important feature of these data is that the variables X1 and X3 are highly
#' correlated, as well as the variables X2 and X4.  Thus we should expect any
#' subset of (X1,X2,X3,X4) that includes one variable from highly correlated
#' pair to do as any subset that also includes the other member.
