\title{Bayesian Adaptive Sampling for Bayesian Model Averaging and Variable Selection in
Linear Models}
\usage{
bas.lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action = "na.omit",
  n.models = NULL, prior = "ZS-null", alpha = NULL,
  modelprior = beta.binomial(1, 1), initprobs = "Uniform",
  include.always = ~1, method = "BAS", update = NULL, bestmodel = NULL,
  prob.local = 0, prob.rw = 0.5, MCMC.iterations = NULL, lambda = NULL,
  delta = 0.025, thin = 1, renormalize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{linear model formula for the full model with all predictors,
Y ~ X.  All code assumes that an intercept will be included in each model
and that the X's will be centered.}

\item{data}{a data frame.  Factors will be converted to numerical vectors based on
the using `model.matrix`.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting
process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. If non-NULL, Bayes estimates
are obtained assuming that Y ~ N(Xb, sigma^2 diag(1/weights)).}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain NAs. The default is "na.omit".}

\item{n.models}{number of models to sample either without replacement
(method="BAS" or "MCMC+BAS") or with replacement (method="MCMC"). If NULL,
BAS with method="BAS" will try to enumerate all 2^p models. If enumeration
is not possible (memory or time) then a value should be supplied which
controls the number of sampled models using 'n.models'.  With method="MCMC",
sampling will stop once the min(n.models, MCMC.iterations) occurs so
MCMC.iterations be significantly larger than n.models in order to explore the model space.
On exit for method= "MCMC" this is the number of unique models that have
been sampled with counts stored in the output as "freq".}

\item{prior}{prior distribution for regression coefficients.  Choices
include
\itemize{
\item "AIC"
\item "BIC"
\item "g-prior", Zellner's g prior where `g` is specified using the argument `alpha`
\item "JZS"  Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow prior which uses the Jeffreys
prior on sigma and the Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior on the coefficients.
The optional parameter `alpha` can be used to control
the squared scale of the prior, where the default is alpha=1. Setting
`alpha` is equal to rscale^2 in the BayesFactor package of Morey.
This uses QUADMATH for numerical integration of g.
\item  "ZS-null", a Laplace approximation to the 'JZS' prior
for integration of g.  alpha = 1 only. We recommend
using 'JZS' for accuracy and compatibility
with the BayesFactor package, although it is
slower.
\item "ZS-full" (to be deprecated)
\item "hyper-g", a mixture of g-priors where the prior on
g/(1+g) is a Beta(1, alpha/2) as in Liang et al (2008).  This
uses the Cephes library for evaluation of the marginal
likelihoods and may be numerically unstable for
large n or R2 close to 1.  Default choice of alpha is 3.
\item "hyper-g-laplace", Same as above but using a Laplace
approximation to integrate over the prior on g.
\item "hyper-g-n", a mixture of g-priors that where
u = g/n and u ~ Beta(1, alpha/2)  to provide consistency
when the null model is true.
\item "EB-local", use the MLE of g from the marginal likelihood
within each model
\item "EB-global" uses an EM algorithm to find a common or
global estimate of g, averaged over all models.  When it is not possible to
enumerate all models, the EM algorithm uses only the
models sampled under EB-local.
}}

\item{alpha}{optional hyperparameter in g-prior or hyper g-prior.  For
Zellner's g-prior, alpha = g, for the Liang et al hyper-g or hyper-g-n
method, recommended choice is alpha are between (2 < alpha < 4), with alpha
= 3 the default.  For the Zellner-Siow prior alpha = 1 by default, but can be used
to modify the rate parameter in the gamma prior on g,  1/g ~ G(1/2, n*alpha/2) so that
beta ~ C(0, sigma^2 alpha (X'X/n)^{-1}).}

\item{modelprior}{Family of prior distribution on the models.  Choices
include \code{\link{uniform}} \code{\link{Bernoulli}} or
\code{\link{beta.binomial}}, \code{\link{tr.beta.binomial}},
(with truncation) \code{\link{tr.poisson}} (a truncated Poisson), and
\code{\link{tr.power.prior}} (a truncated power family),
 with the default being a
\code{beta.binomial(1,1)}.  Truncated versions are useful for p > n.}

\item{initprobs}{Vector of length p or a character string specifying which
method is used to create the vector. This is used to order variables for
sampling all methods for potentially more efficient storage while sampling
and provides the initial inclusion probabilities used for sampling without
replacement with method="BAS".  Options for the character string giving the
method are: "Uniform" or "uniform" where each predictor variable is equally
likely to be sampled (equivalent to random sampling without replacement);
"eplogp" uses the \code{\link{eplogprob}} function to approximate the Bayes
factor from p-values from the full model to find initial marginal inclusion
probabilities; "marg-eplogp" uses\code{\link{eplogprob.marg}} function to
aproximate the Bayes factor from p-values from the full model each simple
linear regression.  To run a Markov Chain to provide initial estimates of
marginal inclusion probabilities for "BAS", use method="MCMC+BAS" below.
While the initprobs are not used in sampling for method="MCMC", this
determines the order of the variables in the lookup table and affects memory
allocation in large problems where enumeration is not feasible.  For
variables that should always be included set the corresponding initprobs to
1, to override the `modelprior` or use `include.always` to force these variables
to always be included in the model.}

\item{include.always}{A formula with terms that should always be included
in the model with probability one.  By default this is `~ 1` meaning that the
intercept is always included.  This will also overide any of the values in `initprobs`
above by setting them to 1.}

\item{method}{A character variable indicating which sampling method to use:
\itemize{
\item  "deterministic" uses the "top k" algorithm described in Ghosh and Clyde (2011)
to sample models in order of approximate probability under conditional independence
using the "initprobs".  This is the most efficient algorithm for enumeration.
\item  "BAS" uses Bayesian Adaptive Sampling (without replacement) using the
sampling probabilities given in initprobs under a model of conditional independence.
These can be updated based on estimates of the marginal inclusion probabilities.
\item  "MCMC" samples with
replacement via a MCMC algorithm that combines the birth/death random walk
in Hoeting et al (1997) of MC3 with a random swap move to interchange a
variable in the model with one currently excluded as described in Clyde,
Ghosh and Littman (2010).
\item  "MCMC+BAS" runs an initial MCMC to
calculate marginal inclusion probabilities and then samples without
replacement as in BAS.  For BAS, the sampling probabilities can be updated
as more models are sampled. (see update below).
}}

\item{update}{number of iterations between potential updates of the sampling
probabilities for method "BAS" or "MCMC+BAS". If NULL do not update, otherwise the
algorithm will update using the marginal inclusion probabilities as they
change while sampling takes place.  For large model spaces, updating is
recommended. If the model space will be enumerated, leave at the default.}

\item{bestmodel}{optional binary vector representing a model to initialize
the sampling. If NULL sampling starts with the null model}

\item{prob.local}{A future option to allow sampling of models "near" the
median probability model.  Not used at this time.}

\item{prob.rw}{For any of the MCMC methods, probability of using the
random-walk Metropolis proposal; otherwise use a random "flip" move
to propose swap a variable that is excluded with a variable in the model.}

\item{MCMC.iterations}{Number of iterations for the MCMC sampler; the
default is n.models*10 if not set by the user.}

\item{lambda}{Parameter in the AMCMC algorithm (depracated).}

\item{delta}{truncation parameter to prevent sampling probabilities to
degenerate to 0 or 1 prior to enumeration for sampling without replacement.}

\item{thin}{For "MCMC", thin the MCMC chain every "thin" iterations; default is no
thinning.  For large p, thinning can be used to significantly reduce memory
requirements as models and associated summaries are saved only every thin iterations.  For thin = p, the  model and associated output are recorded every p iterations,
similar to the Gibbs sampler in SSVS.}

\item{renormalize}{For MCMC sampling, should posterior probabilities be
based on renormalizing the marginal likelihoods times prior probabilities
(TRUE) or frequencies from MCMC.  The latter are unbiased in long runs,
while the former may have less variability.  May be compared via the
diagnostic plot function \code{\link{diagnostics}}.
See details in Clyde and Ghosh (2012).}

The function \code{\link{summary.bas}}, is used to print a summary of the
results. The function \code{\link{plot.bas}} is used to plot posterior
distributions for the coefficients and \code{\link{image.bas}} provides an
image of the distribution over models.  Posterior summaries of coefficients
can be extracted using \code{\link{coefficients.bas}}.  Fitted values and
predictions can be obtained using the S3 functions \code{\link{fitted.bas}}
and \code{\link{predict.bas}}.  BAS objects may be updated to use a
different prior (without rerunning the sampler) using the function
\code{\link{update.bas}}. For MCMC sampling \code{\link{diagnostics}} can be used
to assess whether the MCMC has run long enough so that the posterior probabilities
are stable. For more details see the associated demos and vignette.

\description{
Sample without replacement from a posterior distribution on models
}
\details{
BAS provides several algorithms to sample from posterior distributions
of models for
use in Bayesian Model Averaging or Bayesian variable selection. For p less than
20-25, BAS can enumerate all models depending on memory availability.  As BAS saves all
models, MLEs, standard errors, log marginal likelihoods, prior and posterior and  probabilities
memory requirements grow linearly with M*p where M is the number of models
and p is the number of predictors.  For example, enumeration with p=21 with 2,097,152 takes just under
2 Gigabytes on a 64 bit machine to store all summaries that would be needed for model averaging.
(A future version will likely include an option to not store all summaries if
users do not plan on using  model averaging or model selection on Best Predictive models.)
For larger p, BAS samples without replacement using random or deterministic
sampling. The Bayesian Adaptive Sampling algorithm of Clyde, Ghosh, Littman
(2010) samples models without replacement using the initial sampling
probabilities, and will optionally update the sampling probabilities every
"update" models using the estimated marginal inclusion probabilties. BAS
uses different methods to obtain the \code{initprobs}, which may impact the
results in high-dimensional problems. The deterministic sampler provides a
list of the top models in order of an approximation of independence using
the provided \code{initprobs}.  This may be effective after running the
other algorithms to identify high probability models and works well if the
correlations of variables are small to modest.
We recommend "MCMC" for
problems where enumeration is not feasible (memory or time constrained)
or even modest p if the number of
models sampled is not close to the number of possible models and/or there are significant
correlations among the predictors as the bias in estimates of inclusion
probabilities from "BAS" or "MSMS+BAS" may be large relative to the reduced
variability from using the normalized model probabilities as shown in Clyde and Ghosh, 2012.
Diagnostic plots with MCMC can be used to assess convergence.
For large problems we recommend thinning with MCMC to reduce memory requirements.
The priors on coefficients
include Zellner's g-prior, the Hyper-g prior (Liang et al 2008, the
Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior, Empirical Bayes (local and global) g-priors.  AIC
and BIC are also included, while a range of priors on the model space are available.
