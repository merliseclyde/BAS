Changes for BAS 1.04

- added bas.glm for model averaging/section using mixture of g-priors for
	GLMs
- support is currently for Logistic Regression
	
Changes for BAS 0.93

- removed internal print statements in bayesglm.c
- Bug fixes in AMCMC algorithm

Changes for BAS 0.92

- fixed glm-fit.R  so that hyperparameter for BIC is numeric

Changes for BAS 0.91

- added new AMCMC algorithm

Changes for BAS 0.91

- bug fix in bayes.glm

CHANGES for BAS 0.90

- added C routines for fitting glms

CHANGES for BAS 0.85

 - fixed problem with duplicate models if n.models was > 2^(p-1) by
   restricting n.models

 - save original X as part of object so that fitted.bma gives the
   correct fitted values (broken in version 0.80)
 
CHANGES for BAS 0.80

- Added hypergeometric2F1 function that is callable by R
- centered X's in bas.lm so that the intercept has the correct
  shrinkage
- changed predict.bma to center newdata using the mean(X)
- Added new Adaptive MCMC option (method = "AMCMC")  (this is not
  stable at this point)

CHANGES for BAS 0.7

 -Allowed pruning of model tree to eliminate rejected models
 
CHANGES for BAS 0.6

- Added MCMC option to create starting values for BAS (method = "MCMC+BAS")

CHANGES for BAS 0.5

-Cleaned up all .Call routines so that all objects are duplicated or
 allocated within code

CHANGES for BAS 0.45

- fixed ch2inv that prevented building on Windows in bayes glm_fit

CHANGES for BAS 0.4

- fixed fortran calls to use F77_NAME macro 
- changed  allocation of objects for .Call to prevent some
  objects from being overwritten.  (still need to replace more)

CHANGES for BAS 0.3

- fixed EB.global function to include prior probabilities on models
- fixed update function 

CHANGES for BAS 0.2

- fixed predict.bma to allow newdata to be a matrix or vector with the
  column of ones for the intercept optionally included.
- fixed help file for predict 
- added modelprior argument to bas.lm so that users may now use the
  beta-binomial prior distribution on model size in addition to the
  default uniform distribution
- added functions uniform(), beta-binomial() and Bernoulli() to create
  model prior objects
- added a vector of user specified initial probabilities as an option for
  argument initprobs in bas.lm and removed the separate argument user.prob
