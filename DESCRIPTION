Description: Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models and
	     generalized linear models using stochastic or
	     deterministic sampling without replacement from posterior
	     distributions.  Prior distributions on coefficients are
	     from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
	     corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
	     mixture of g-priors from 
	     Liang et al (2008)
	     <http://dx.doi.org/10.1198/016214507000001337>
	     for linear models or mixtures of
	     g-priors in GLMs of Li and Clyde (2015)
	     <http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06913>. Other model
	     selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g.
	     Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models
	     using Sampling w/out Replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm
	     samples models using the BAS tree structure as an efficient
	     hash table. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on
	     model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model
	     space may be used.  The user may force variables to always be included. 
	     Details behind the sampling algorithm are provided in
	     Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049>.
