Description: Bayesian Variable Selection and  Model Averaging 
    in linear models and generalized linear models implemented using
    prior distributions on coefficients based on
    Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
    corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
    mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008)
    <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337>
    for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from  Li and Clyde
    (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear models.
    Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes 
    estimates of g. Models may be sampled using Markov Chain Monte 
    Carlo, a deterministic sampler (for enumeration) or 
    sampling without replacement. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on
    the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement using a tree structure of the model space 
    as an efficient hash table.  See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) 
    <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms.
    Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on
    model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model
    space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank.  
    The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing
    constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their 
    parents are included in the model.
