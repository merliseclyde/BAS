Description: Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models and
	     generalized linear models using stochastic or
	     deterministic sampling without replacement from posterior
	     distributions.  Prior distributions on coefficients are
	     from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
	     corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
	     Liang et al hyper-g priors (JASA 2008) or mixtures of
	     g-priors in GLMS of Li and Clyde 2015. Other model
	     selection criteria include AIC and BIC. Sampling
	     probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models
	     using Sampling w/out Replacement or an MCMC algorithm
	     samples models using the BAS tree structure as an efficient
	     hash table. Allows uniform or beta-binomial prior distributions on
	     models, and may force variables to always be included.
